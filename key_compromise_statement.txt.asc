Urgent: Important Notice Regarding My GPG Key (D21E50610A7130BBFF8B6294BE649EDA7126F01C)

To all my contacts and anyone relying on my GPG key:

My name is Robert. I am issuing this urgent notice to inform you that the private master GPG key associated with the following fingerprint is no longer under my control and should be considered compromised/lost:

Old Master Key Fingerprint: D21E 5061 0A71 30BB FF8B  6294 BE64 9EDA 7126 F01C

This key was stored on an encrypted partition that has become inaccessible due to data corruption. As a result, I am unable to revoke it formally.

Therefore, please DO NOT trust any future signatures or encryption made with the aforementioned old master key. You should immediately mark it as untrusted or invalidate it in your local GPG keyring.

I have generated a new master GPG key. My new public key fingerprint is:
New Master Key Fingerprint: 9033 C06B C9A1 FA15 FA9F  E88F 0906 03E5 5AA0 49C4

You can find my new public key on keys.openpgp.org by searching for my email address or by its fingerprint at:
https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/9033C06BC9A1FA15FA9FE88F090603E55AA049C4

Please update your GPG keyring to use my new key for all future communications.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Robert
July 30, 2025
